**Title: "Faded Letters"**

Lily sat by the window, watching the rain trickle down the glass. She held a stack of old, yellowed letters in her hands, each one written by Ethan, the love of her life. They had met in college, their love blooming amidst late-night study sessions and shared dreams of traveling the world.

But life had other plans. After graduation, Ethan had been offered a prestigious job overseas. They had promised each other they would make it work, no matter the distance. For a while, they did. Letters arrived every week, full of love, longing, and plans for the future. Every letter ended with the same words: *"I will come back for you."*

But as time passed, the letters became less frequent, and Lilyâ€™s heart began to ache with the growing distance between them. She wrote back, waiting for replies that came later and later, until one day, they stopped altogether. 

Lily never heard from Ethan again.

Years later, she found out through mutual friends that he had fallen in love with someone else while abroad. The love they had shared, so strong and bright, had faded away like the ink on the letters she now held. She never moved on, never stopped waiting for a letter that never came.

And so, Lily sat by the window, watching the rain fall, clutching the letters that once held so much hope, whispering into the empty room, *"I never stopped waiting."*
